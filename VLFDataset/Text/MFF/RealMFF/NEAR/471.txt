The counterpart to the left, this image directs attention to the bench itself, with the background now blurred, bringing the texture and detail of the wood grain into prominence. The armrest on the near-focus image is clearly defined, with the vertical slats creating a rhythmic pattern. The focus on the near objects emphasizes the craftsmanship of the bench, with the backdrop of the paved area now serving merely as a context rather than a focal point.
