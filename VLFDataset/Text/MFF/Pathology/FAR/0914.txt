The far-focus image focuses on a different set of cells, which appear more elongated and spread out. The nuclei are still visible, but the overall image is slightly blurrier, indicating that the focus is not as sharp as in the first image. The cells seem to be in a different arrangement, possibly indicating a different stage of development or a different type of cell.
