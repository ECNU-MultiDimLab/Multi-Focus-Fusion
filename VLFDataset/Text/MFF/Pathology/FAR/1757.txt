The far-focus image presents a different cluster of cells, with the focus shifted to reveal a different set of cellular structures. The cells in this image appear slightly blurred, suggesting that the depth of field is shallower, and the focus is on a different plane within the sample. The overall composition highlights the variation in cellular morphology and arrangement.
