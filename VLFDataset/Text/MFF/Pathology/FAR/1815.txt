The far-focus image presents another group of cells, with the focus shifted to highlight a different set of features. The nuclei are still prominent, but the emphasis here seems to be on the cellular boundaries and possibly the cytoplasmic content. The cells appear more uniformly round and are less densely packed compared to the first image. The clarity of the focus allows for the examination of these distinct cellular characteristics.
