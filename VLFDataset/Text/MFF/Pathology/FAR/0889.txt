The defocused image reveals a distinct cell cluster, where the shifted focal plane primarily highlights the spatial organization and surface texture characteristics of the cells. Compared with the initial micrograph, these cells exhibit reduced edge definition and diminished internal structural resolution, indicating the imaging emphasis lies in the collective distribution pattern and surface properties of the cell population rather than their ultrastructural details.
