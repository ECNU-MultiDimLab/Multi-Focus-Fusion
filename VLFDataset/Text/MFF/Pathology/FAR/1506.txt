The far-focus image focuses on a different set of dark, circular structures that are also likely cell nuclei. These nuclei are grouped closely together, and the background is similarly pink and out of focus, indicating that this image is also capturing a cellular environment. The nuclei appear slightly larger and more prominent in this image.
