The far-focus image shifts the focus to a different set of cells, which are also in close proximity but exhibit different characteristics. The nuclei are more prominent, and the cytoplasmic details are less distinct compared to the first image. The background in this image is similarly out of focus, drawing attention to the specific cells that are in focus.
