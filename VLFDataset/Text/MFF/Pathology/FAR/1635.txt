The far-focus image shifts the focus to the nucleus and nucleolus, highlighting the dense and compact nature of these structures. The nucleus is clearly visible as a dark, circular region, and the nucleolus within it appears even darker, suggesting a higher concentration of proteins and ribosomal RNA. The surrounding cytoplasm is slightly blurred, emphasizing the contrast between the nucleus and the rest of the cell.
