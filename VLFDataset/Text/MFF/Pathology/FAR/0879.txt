The telecentric imaging system distinctly visualizes the fibrous network within the background region, demonstrating interconnected linear and punctate architectures. This area exhibits superior resolution and structural delineation compared to other image sectors, with the fibrous components prominently contrasted against the defocused, hypochromatic foreground. The intentional focus gradient establishes optimal contrast dynamics that diagnostically emphasize the fibrillar matrix as the primary morphological feature.
