The far-focus image presents a different cluster of cells, with the focus shifted to a different plane. In this instance, the cells appear more blurred and less distinct, suggesting that the focal point is not on the cells themselves but rather on a different layer or depth within the sample. The overall clarity is reduced compared to the first image.
