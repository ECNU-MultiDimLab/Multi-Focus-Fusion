The far-focus image focuses on a different set of cells, which appear more blurred and less distinct compared to the first image. The outlines of the cells are not as sharp, and the details of the cellular structures are not as clearly visible. The overall appearance is softer, with a more uniform distribution of color, indicating a shallower depth of field or a different focal plane.
